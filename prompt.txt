Project Idea: Movie Recommendation System

Create a movie recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on their preferences and past viewing history. The system will use collaborative filtering techniques to find similar users and recommend movies that those similar users have enjoyed.

Requirements:
##############

Build a dataset of movies and users with their ratings. You can use publicly available movie datasets or create your own sample data.

Implement a function to calculate similarity between users. You can use techniques like Pearson correlation coefficient, cosine similarity, or Jaccard similarity.

Create a function to find the top 'k' most similar users to a given user.

Implement a function to generate movie recommendations for a user by aggregating ratings from similar users and suggesting movies with high aggregated ratings.

Develop a user interface (command-line or web-based) that allows users to input their movie preferences and get movie recommendations based on their input.

##############

Optional Enhancements:

Incorporate item-based collaborative filtering to improve the recommendation system.

Use machine learning algorithms like matrix factorization (e.g., Singular Value Decomposition or Alternating Least Squares) to make more accurate predictions.

Add a feature for users to rate recommended movies and update the recommendation system based on their feedback.

Build a web-based interface using frameworks like Flask or Django.

##############

Learning Opportunities:

This project will help you understand collaborative filtering techniques, data manipulation, similarity calculations, and user interface development. It's a great way to practice handling real-world data and improving your problem-solving skills.

Remember to start with smaller sub-tasks and gradually build up to the complete project. Break down the problem into manageable steps and test each component thoroughly to ensure it works as expected. Good luck, and have fun!
